# Weather-App

This app is designed to display the current weather conditions at a specific location 

Currently it includes two modules, both of which are designed to run in your console/terminal.

  The first module displays details of the most recently available weather conditions using Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) data.

  The second module displays the base64 representation of the most recently available photo of the location using Air Services Australia weather cameras.

Currently the app is being tested on Toowoomba Wellcamp Airport.
